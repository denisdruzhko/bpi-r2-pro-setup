## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Encountered

1. **SD card damage with SD_FIRMWARE_TOOL**  
   - Using the official SD booting tool led to the **permanent damage of several SD cards**.  
   - One SD card was flashed successfully only once.  
   - Another card worked for a few flashes, then failed irreparably.

2. **Official images failed to flash**  
   - Flashing official images resulted in errors (details vary).  
   - Flashing **custom images from Google Drive** worked ([link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hnwcoPpNmWwCk9qxqjAeIQQEqt4mjjhG)), but created partitioning problems:
     - Only 6GB out of 14GB was available.
     - Attempts to resize or repartition failed with various tools.

  **Password**: `bananapi`

#### Method 2: Flashing with EMMCBoot (manual image layout)

- Download and extract an image built for **EMMCBoot**.
- Open **"Download Image"** tab in **RKDevTool**.
- For each image component (`rootfs.img`, `recovery.img`, `misc.img`, `uboot.img`, `boot.img`, `parameter.txt`, `MiniLoaderAll.bin` as loader), specify paths manually.
- Uncheck or remove rows that don‚Äôt match.
- Connect module in **Maskrom mode**.
